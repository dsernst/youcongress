<div class="py-4 text-lg font-semibold text-center bg-blue-100">Welcome to YouCongress!</div>
<p class="mt-4">
  YouCongress is an initiative designed to enhance decision-making in an environment where diverse opinions thrive, where change of opinion is celebrated and leads to individual and collective learning.
</p>

<p class="pt-6">We're still shaping YouCongress, but you already can:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5">
  <li>create a voting</li>
  <li>vote (votes are public)</li>
  <li>add arguments</li>
  <li>explore AI-generated opinions from public figures</li>
  <li>
    delegate to other users and public figures. You'll vote as the majority of your delegates â€” unless you vote directly.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="mt-4">Be humble to change your mind, be bold to convince others.</p>
