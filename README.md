# YouCongress

Welcome to YouCongress!

YouCongress is an open-source project designed to enhance decision-making in an environment where diverse opinions thrive, where change of opinion is celebrated and leads to individual and collective learning.

We're still shaping YouCongress, but you already can:
- create a voting
- vote (votes are public)
- add arguments
- explore AI-generated opinions from public figures
- delegate to other users and public figures. You'll vote as the majority of your delegates â€” unless you vote directly.
